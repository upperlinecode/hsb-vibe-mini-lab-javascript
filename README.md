## TL;DR

Use what you just learned about HSB colors to create a vibe with your partner.

## Intro

The Hue-Saturation-Brightness model of color is super useful because it allows us to specify colors numerically in a more natural way. In particular, by holding saturation and / or brightness constant, we're able to generate colors that seem to match, even if they'd appear on opposite ends of the rainbow.

In this lab, you are your partner will use this technique (or whatever other strategy strikes your fancy), to create a colorful vibe in p5.

## The Lab

Start off by identifying your target vibe with your partner. This can be anything (party, wistful, brocoli, etc.); the important thing is that it gives you a feeling.

Once you've agreed on your vibe, think about how you can create it with color and shapes. You won't have time for detailed imagery, so think about how you can display your vibe abstractly.

(If you need it, there's a great HSB color picker [here](https://codepen.io/HunorMarton/details/eWvewo), although try to figure out your colors without it first.)
